The field, MenuItemKey, in tblCharts needs to be populated.  Several 
Charts will be assigned to each menu item key.  You can use the 
tblOfContentsChartName to make a good guess about which charts belong on 
a page.

You may want to start by getting glsMenuItems in order first.
I assigned page names to each of the items, but they are not in order 
that they appear on the page.
The sort field is not populated in glsMenuItems.
Note that the sort is within a MenuSection, which is already assigned to 
each menu item.

If you want, you can rename the page names.

SELECT * FROM glsColumnLabels WHERE ViewName = 'insuranceChartA1': 

1. MUST Populate glscolumnlabels first
	- viewname is in tblcharts as sqlview

Liam is chipping away on populating tblCharts and creating views


Source, sources, classdata, classtitle

Menusort: glsMenuItems sort can be populated - within each section
